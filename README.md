# Project 2 : Item Catalog

## Project Details:

You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

## Getting Started:

To start on this project, you'll need database software (provided by a Linux virtual machine) and the data to analyze.

### The virtual machine

1. Install VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1

2. Install Vagrant from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

3. Download and unzip the VM configuration from https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/April/5acfbfa3_fsnd-virtual-machine/fsnd-virtual-machine.zip

4.  Change to this directory in your terminal with `cd`. Inside, you will find another directory called vagrant. Change directory to the vagrant directory.

### Start the virtual machine

5. From your terminal, inside the vagrant subdirectory, run the command `vagrant up`. This will cause Vagrant to download the Linux operating system and install it. This may take quite a while (many minutes) depending on how fast your Internet connection is.

6. When vagrant up is finished running, you will get your shell prompt back. At this point, you can run `vagrant ssh` to log in to your newly installed Linux VM.

### Running the code

7. Clone this repository and `cd` to its directory.
 
8. From your terminal run the command `python server.py`
